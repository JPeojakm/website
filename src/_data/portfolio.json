To make the data accessible to the public, we needed clear categories, not vague labels like “Negative Economic Impacts.” We followed a framework from the <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/arpa-investment-tracker/\">Brookings</a>, which had categorized ARPA data for one county in Maryland. My editor and I researched their eight categories, adapting them to Maine’s data. This was tricky—no fixed standards existed. For instance, Brookings sometimes categorized COVID-19 responses in jails as “Public Safety” instead of “Public Health.”"

The Maine Monitor’s reporter reviewed our classifications, helping us make adjustments like changing “Police Department” to “Sheriff’s Office” and adding a “County Jail” category. Once we finished one quarter, automation sped up the process, but differences across years required manual checks. Thanks to weekly check-ins and real-time feedback, Aarushi and I completed the coding in just one and a half weeks."
