          <noscript>Hey, I’m Jinpeng Li, also go by "JP".</noscript>
      
        <p>I’m a Data Graphics fellow at Business Insider. I specialize in data analysis and visualization to enhance storytelling and traditional reporting.</p>

         <p>Previously, I was a researcher at The Dallas Morning News, where I used OSINT skills to check local election candidates' backgrounds and built in-house data tools for reporters and subscribers.</p>

        <p>I was also a data reporting fellow at <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/jinpeng-li/" class="link">The Washington Post</a>. I was assigned to the sports desk to cover the 2024 Paris Olympic, researching the factors behind <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/08/09/small-countries-olympic-medals/" class="link">Olympic podium success</a>. Later, I collaborated with the Asia team to feature <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2025/03/03/china-renewable-energy-green-world-leader/" class="link">China’s clean energy dominance</a>, from solar power to electric vehicles.</p>
        <p>Simultaneously, I served in a similar role at the <a href="https://investigativereportingworkshop.org/staff/jp-li/" class="link">Investigative Reporting Workshop</a>, an innovative “training hospital” journalism nonprofit based at American University in Washington, D.C. through Dow Jones News Fund. There, I analyzed D.C. crime and shooting data, tracked <a href="https://themainemonitor.org/arpa/" class="link">Maine’s use of ARPA funds</a>, and explored 30 years of U.S. Census data using various tools.</p>
        <p>I hold a master’s degree in journalism and media from the University of Texas at Austin, studied finance in college.</p>
        <p>I moved to New York City from ATX and am still learning to be a New Yorker. You can reach me at forjpli(at)gmail(dot)com.</p>
